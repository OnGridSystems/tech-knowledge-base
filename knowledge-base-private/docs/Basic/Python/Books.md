# Books

The books here are presented in ascending order by accessibility of the material presented. At the bottom of the list are some optional books that will not really harm you programming skills if skipped, but the might definitely expand your horizons. Some of them are available online free of charge, some are not, so feel free to explore.

## Entry Level

Even though programming languages progress and change at a considerably fast rate, their foundations usually remain unchanged, so here we have picked some books that can help you get a good perspective of Python. The idea of an introductory manual is to give you basic understanding of the language and in that respect these books are more or less equal (except for Learning Python), so you do not have to read every single one of them completely. Pick whichever one will suit you best, optionally supplement it with another, then read Learning Python and you are good to go.

## Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages 1st Edition, Bill Lubanovic

This book provides one of the most beginner-friendly introductions to the language and if you are just beginning it will allow you to start without being overwhelmed by excessive technical details. 

## Practical Programming (2nd edition) An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3, Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, Jason Montojo

This book is one of the introductory books to Python and it lies somewhere between "Introducing Python..." and "Dive into Python" in terms of complexity, so it can be read in parallel/in addition to either of those.

## Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Al Sweigart

[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) This is a very hands-on guide to learning basic Python and it is a bit different from others. "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" is an informal but still useful manual that will give you considerable amount of information.  

## Dive into Python, Mark Pilgrim

[Dive into Python](https://diveintopython3.net/) This book steps up the difficulty a bit, but it is a great guide to the language with a lot of code examples and explanations. It is definitely a harder read than the previous book, but even with that in mind, it is quite accessible.

## Learning Python, 5th Edition, Mark Lutz

This one is the canonical Python manual, some of its parts are a bit dated since it was released with Python 3.3 in mind, but you should definitely consider reading it due to the profound exploration of all features of the language and analysis of the more obscure parts of Python which is not common outside of specialized blogs. This one is the most advanced manual of this level so it may be read after studying other resources.
