# Python Projects

Below is the list of various active projects in Python, feel free to check them out, read the docs, follow the tutorials and use them to build your projects based on the ideas from Practice Tasks here!  
To get the most out of the links below, do the following:  

- compare and contrast docs from various projects - while all of the software there is very well made and maintained, documentation quality varies;  
- pay attention to how exactly any given project is built - is it dockerized, if yes, then how exactly, does it go through some sort of pipeline on build, what kind of tests are run on every build (bonus points if you look into failed builds and read the logs as to why the build failed), how various linting/formatting hooks are run etc.;  
- try and contrast how and when projects of a certain group (i.e. web frameworks) are used, when one is preferred to another (the classic example would be Django vs. Flask) and what strengths/weaknesses they have;  

## Django
[Django Official Site](https://www.djangoproject.com) - the best example of project documentation online.
[Django Mozilla Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) - Django Tutorial by Mozilla. Slightly more extensive than the official Django tutorial, so might be worth checking out.
