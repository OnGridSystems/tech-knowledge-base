# Further Reading 

These books pick up where the books from the basic section stop and deal with more advanced/professional programming topics.

### Learning Python, 5th Edition, Mark Lutz
This book has already been suggested in the entry level section, but if there it was something from the "see also" category, here it is more of a "required read". While by no means an absolute must-read, you still should consider reading it before moving on to more advanced literature.

### Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python (Effective Software Development Series), Brett Slatkin
This book is not a manual in the same sense as "Learning Python" or "Dive into Python", rather, it is a collection of articles on how to write better code. While some of the advice presented there seems obvious (like checking the version of Python used in the project) all of it is valuable knowledge which should not be forgotten.

### Serious Python Black-Belt Advice on Deployment, Scalability, Testing, and More, Julien Danjou
Coming from No Starch Press, this book, while informal, is definitely a serious practical advice from an experienced professional. It deals with more mundane things like deployment, testing, optimizing etc.

### Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming, Luciano Ramalho
Strictly speaking, this is not a junior book by any means - it explores very advanced concepts and generall reads like a continuation of "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz. The reason why it is included here is to show you the perspective of an experienced professional and provide you with an overview of topics like concurrency, good-to-know practices of OOP, metaprogramming and additional information regarding the most basic things like working with strings vs. bytes etc.  

## Optional Reading
### Impractical Python Projects Playful Programming Activities to Make You Smarter, Lee Vaughan
By no means a formal guide, this book will teach you some programming pratices by walking you through, appropriately enough, impractical but quite complex projects.

### Python Playground, Mahesh Venkitachalam
In the same vein as "Impractical Python Projects..." this book aims to introduce you to some new libraries and programming concepts in a very informal way.
