# Resources

This page deals with online resouces for Python programmers.

## Real Python
Most definitely one of the best, if not the best, resources dedicated to all levels of Python development.  
[Real Python Basics](https://realpython.com/tutorials/basics/) - most of these tutorials are appropriate for the beginners  
[Real Python Intermediate](https://realpython.com/tutorials/intermediate/) - continue with these  

## Free Code Camp
Another resource, while not strictly about Python, has a lot of articles. The main difference is that Free Code Camp mostly deals with practical cases and solution, rather than theoretical articles

## Reddit
[Python Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/) - is a place to engage with the Python community on Reddit. This reddit is dedicated to general Python news, questions etc.
[Learn Python Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) - this community will actually be of more interest in the beginning, since here you may ask questions about the issues you encounter, read questions by the other community members, and all that in a more informal and beginner-friendly environment than that on StackOverflow

## Stack Overflow
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-3.x%20python?sort=Newest&edited=true) - Stack Overflow search filtered by Python-related tags. Looking through the accepted answers, especially on very popular questions, is a decent way to learn a solution to your problem or even something completely new.

## WTF Python
[WTF Python Github](https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython) - some common Python mistakes in a form of a cheat sheet.
